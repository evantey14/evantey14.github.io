Over the past few weeks, I've been working on several projects. First, my team, Steam Locomotive, competed in PicoCTF. As I was busy with other work, I could only work at the beginning and end of the competition. Most of the problems I did were the simple ones at the beginning or had to do with math. Our team finished 18th in the competition though we had been wavering around 10th place for the majority of the two weeks.

Also since my last blog post, we went on a Science Olympiad competition. This means my calculator was put to good use. (This is a project I've been working on since sophomore year. It's a calculator written in Javascript tailored towards astrophysical calculation.) The two teams that used it placed 1st and 2nd, so I'm pretty happy with where it is. As we have another competition in about three weeks, I plan on touching up and potentially adding some function. This project is all about efficiency, so one aspect I need to change is accessibility to equations. Currently users have to scroll up and down a page to find each equation which often takes longer than using the equations themselves.
