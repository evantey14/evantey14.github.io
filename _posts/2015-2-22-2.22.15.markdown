This week was Test Off week for Science Olympiad. In preparation for my Astronomy test I opened tabs where I Google image searched the different DSOs. Since the layout is very much like a tiling Pinterest interface. If we make it to nationals, I would very much like to create an identical local page because it gives very easy and efficient access to finding DSO images and clicking on them to retrieve quick information (what the picture is/what's in the picture/where the picture is from/etc).
