Over the last few weeks, I've been able to relax and start making plans for 2nd semester projects. I think one of my main projects will be to review the algorithm textbook in preparation for college next year and the possibility of interning over the summer. The last time I touched any of this stuff was 2nd semester freshman year, so a refresher is in order. 

As far as utility projects, I plan on working with Justin to create a program in TI-Basic that can quickly conduct calculations and conversions related to time in physics and time keeping systems. The goal of this is efficient use in the SciO event It's About Time. 

Aside from these two main ideas, I haven't thought of any large projects that I might do for this semester, so I'll take some time to think of more.
